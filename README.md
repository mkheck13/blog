# Blog API

## OverView
    We're building a simple Blog using .Net and EFCore, as well as JWT Token for Authentication

## Features

**User Creation and Authentication (Login)** using JWT Tokens
**Create, Update, Publish,  and Unpublish our Blogs**
**Soft Delete Blogs** (This will keep them hidden but still in our system just in case the FBI needs :3)
**Search BLogs** (By different Categories)

## Endpoints

## Async Methods in C#

Async Methods in C# are used when queries databases without blocking our main thread
